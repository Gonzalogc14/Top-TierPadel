      <p class="Texto">
        Padel, a dynamic racquet sport originating from Mexico, combines elements of tennis and squash, played on an
        enclosed court with walls, using solid rackets and a depressurized ball. This setup fosters intense rallies and
        strategic gameplay, making every match an exciting challenge. The sport's unique aspects include the use of
        underhand serves and the allowance of wall plays, which contribute to the distinctiveness and growing global
        popularity of padel.
      </p>

      <h2 class="history-subtitle">How many people can play?</h2>
      <p class="history-text">
        Padel is typically played in doubles format, allowing four players to participate on the court at a time: two
        players on each team. This encourages collaboration and communication, making it an ideal team sport. For
        teaching purposes or clinics, more players can engage in a class on the same court, allowing for comprehensive
        instruction, practice sessions, and a fun, social environment that enhances learning and enjoyment of the game.
      </p>

      <h2 class="history-subtitle">What are the rules?</h2>
      <p class="history-text">
        - Service: Underhand serve diagonally, allowing one bounce in each service box. This unique service rule
        emphasizes skill over power, making it accessible to players of all ages and abilities.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Court Boundaries: The enclosed court with walls creates a distinctive play area; balls can be played off walls
        after bouncing, adding an extra tactical dimension to the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        - Scoring: Scoring in padel is similar to tennis, with points earned progressively from 15 to 40, and a deuce at
        40-40. This familiar scoring system makes it easy for fans of traditional racquet sports to understand and
        follow padel matches.

        These rules govern gameplay in padel, ensuring a balance between competitive spirit and fair play. With a blend
        of strategy and physical effort, padel offers a comprehensive sporting experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="history-subtitle">Why is it the perfect sport for educational institutions?</h2>
      <p class="history-text">
        Padel is a perfect addition to educational curriculums for its inclusive nature and its ability to foster
        teamwork, physical fitness, and essential life skills such as strategic thinking, agility, and hand-eye
        coordination. Its enclosed court and the slower pace of play compared to other racquet sports ensure safety for
        young learners, while the engaging and fast-paced nature of the game keeps students interested. Incorporating
        padel into school sports programs can also promote social interaction, friendly competition, and a lifelong
        appreciation for health and fitness.
